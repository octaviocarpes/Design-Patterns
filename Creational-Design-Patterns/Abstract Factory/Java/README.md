# Abstract Factory

<p>
The Abstract Factory defines a Factory Method per product. Each Factory Method encapsulates the new operator and the concrete, platform-specific, product classes. Each "platform" is then modeled with a Factory derived class.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of the Abstract Factory is to provide an interface for creating families of related objects, without specifying concrete classes.
